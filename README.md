### THIS HUD IS GROSSLY UNOPTIMIZED AND CAN TANK YOUR PERFORMANCE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# ZeesHUD
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI.
Originally made in late 2020 as a quarantine project and a 1k subscribers special to my channel.

It is no longer in active developement. I no longer provide any support or updates, and as such pull requests will be ignored. You are free to modify and tweak this HUD as your own.
