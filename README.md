# ZeesHUD
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI.
Originally made in late 2020 as a quarantine project and a 1k subscribers special to my channel. It is no longer in active developement.


# INSTALLATION
- Click **Code** *(that big green button above the list of files)* and click **Download ZIP**
- Drag and drop the folder **ZeesHUD-main** in **team fortress 2/tf/custom/**
- Boot the game up. Voilà.

# zeeshud-x-beta Branch
The **zeeshud-x-beta** branch is an unfinished refresh of ZeesHUD's look. Due to the fact that I need to pay rent, I stopped working on this project as it would be a waste of time. You are free to finish this build and make it your own project.
