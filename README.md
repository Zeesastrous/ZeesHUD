# ZeesHUD
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI.
Originally made in late 2020 as a quarantine project and a 1k subscribers special to my channel.

It is no longer in active developement. As such, the creator will no longer provide any support. You are free to modify and tweak this HUD as your own, under the condition that if you publish your edit, you keep the ZeesHUD name.


# INSTALLATION
- Click **Code** *(that big green button above the list of files)* and click **Download ZIP**
- Drag and drop the folder **ZeesHUD-main** in **team fortress 2/tf/custom/**
- Boot the game up. Voilà.

# zeeshud-x-beta Branch
The **zeeshud-x-beta** branch is an unfinished refresh of ZeesHUD's look. Instead of keeping a flat 70s punk zine aesthetic, this version looks closer to a futuristic display that could be shown on a helmet of some sort. Most in-game assets were finished, but the menus are still from the previous ZeesHUD version.
